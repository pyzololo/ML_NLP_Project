1. modify time to have only one time zone (DONE)
2. split the data into 3 sets (to have different time in each one) (DONE)
3. tokenize words in texts, removing unnecessary marks like !@#$% (DONE)
4. check languages once again and remove stop words (for each language or translate everything into english) (DONE)
5. vectorize texts (DONE)
6. include marks statistics in df
7. Analyze number of clusters based on created charts and dendrogram
8. create models:
9. Create K-Means, K-Medoids or Mini Batch model
10. Try hierarchical clustering - dendrograms
11. Other models to try: DBSCAN, GMM, ...
12. Analyze results, comparing models by some measures and creating some charts
13. Posiibly reduce dimensions, but models will be harder to interpret
14. Make interpretation of clusters
