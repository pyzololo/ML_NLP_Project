1. modify time to have only one time zone (DONE)
2. split the data into 3 sets (to have different time in each one) (DONE)
3. tokenize words in texts, removing unnecessary marks like !@#$% (DONE)
4. check languages once again and remove stop words (for each language or translate everything into english) (DONE)
5. vectorize texts (DONE)
6. Analyze number of clusters based on created charts and dendrogram
7. create models:
8. Create K-Means, K-Medoids or Mini Batch model
9. Try hierarchical clustering - dendrograms
10. Other models to try: DBSCAN, GMM, ...
11. Analyze results, comparing models by some measures and creating some charts
12. Posiibly reduce dimensions, but models will be harder to interpret
13. Make interpretation of clusters
