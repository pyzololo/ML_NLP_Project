1. modify time to have only one time zone
2. split the data into 3 sets (to have different time in each one)
3. tokenize words in texts, removing unnecessary marks like !@#$%
4. check languages once again and remove stop words (for each language or translate everything into english)
5. vectorize texts by word counts
6. create models (K-means, SVM, ...)
